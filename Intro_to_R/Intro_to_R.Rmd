--

- free, open source
--

- very good statistical packages
--

- easy plotting
--

- great package ecosystem
--

- as a researcher (not developer) I find the syntax easy to understand
--

- RStudio 
--

  - It's a great IDE with many features to make your life easy
  - RStudio employes developers who create and continiously support/maintain/develop major packages in the R ecosystem
  - The `tidyverse` and pipes ` %>% `
  - `markdown` support for creating report/slides/books...

Models for `lm` are specified symbolically. A typical model has the form `response ~ terms` where `response` is the (numeric) response vector and `terms` is a series of terms which specifies a linear predictor for `response`. 

For more info check out the documentation with `?lm`.

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
```


---

# R Plots - base R

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```


---

# R Plots - ggplot2

```{r , fig.height=4, dev='svg'}

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)

```
