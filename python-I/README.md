This folder will serve as the basis for the Python I session to be held on Monday, Feb. 10, 2020.

While the name of this session is Python I, this is not necessarily an introduction to Python and experience with the language is assumed. In general it will be assumed that you know how to write loops and conditionals and are familiar with the basics of Python.

If you would like to review some of the basics of Python, check out the [Intro to Python](IntroPython.ipynb) notebook.
