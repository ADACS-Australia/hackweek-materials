## Bad Examples

This directory highlights some badly written c/c++ code using several APIs. 
The goal is to highlight errors in parallel programming and brainstorm fixes.
Feel free to alter the codes to explore how to not write parallel code. 

One can compile the code using 
```
make
```

This assumes that gcc/g++ compilers are available, that mpi compilers are mpicc/mpic++ and 
these compilers have openmp, pthreads and openacc implemented.
