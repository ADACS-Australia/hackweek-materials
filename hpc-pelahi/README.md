# hackweek-materials for HPC

Material related to an intro to HPC. Ideally we will make use of [ozstar.swin.edu.au], project oz989. The working directory will be in /fred/oz989/ADACS/HPC/

For these hands on sessions, if you wish to run on your own machine, you will need
- gcc/g++ >=4.9 to have c++11
- MPI with [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/) >=3.0
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Rmpi](https://wiki.rc.usf.edu/index.php/R_and_Rmpi), [gpuR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gpuR/vignettes/gpuR.pdf)
- Python >=3, [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html), [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=multiprocessing#module-multiprocessing)
