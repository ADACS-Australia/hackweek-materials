# Python II

These are the notes for the second python session, which is split into three
sections:

    1. The Python Data Model (classes, objects, iteration, etc.)
    2. Modules and Packaging
    3. Useful Tools

It's likely we'll only get through the first 2 sections, the 3 should be set up
such that you're directed to a number of useful resources for further reading.

There are three jupyter notebooks in this directory, one for each section. They
use RISE, a system which produces presentations from jupyter notebooks, the
requirements to run these are in the requirement.txt file.

There's also some template files for packaging, feel free to use those in your
packages.
