Software Development and Continuous Integration
===============================================
This contains the two presentations that will be used for the Software Dev & CI session.
The first presentation mainly focuses on what is required besides good Python coding, to make a Python package.
The second presentation goes into detail on how to use code coverage (CodeCov) and continuous integration (Travis CI) to be a lazy package builder.
For this session, we make use of the repo that can be found `here <https://github.com/1313e/software-dev>`_.
