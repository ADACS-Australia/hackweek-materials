### Slides
For the Intro to Machine Learning talk you can follow the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1do8VenOVRAG_iJqVrJEQp_oN7P42jek7J7aDnVZfKm4/edit?usp=sharing).

### Example Material
For hands-on examples we will look at the material in this repo: https://github.com/ADACS-Australia/ANITA-school-2019
Below is the excerpt of the requirements to run the notebooks.

**Prerequisites**

A working knowledge of Python and Jupyter notebooks is essential for this workshop. i.e. 
knowledge of basic data structures, operations and how to write scripts. 
The Python notebooks used throughout the workshop have been developed using Python 3.6.3.

**Required packages:**

-	**NumPy**: a fast numerical array structure and helper functions
-	**pandas**: a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently
-	**matplotlib**: a basic plotting library; most other plotting libraries are built on top of it
-	**seaborn**: a advanced statistical plotting library
-	**scikit-learn**: a machine learning package, more info [here](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- 	**Keras**: a high-level API for implementing neural networks, more info [here](https://keras.io/) 

The datasets used in this workshop are either part of the machine learning packages or 
were compiled from the [Galaxy Zoo DR1](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/), 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ([using the DR9 SQL search](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr9/en/tools/search/sql.asp)), and
the Galaxy And Mass Assembly ([GAMA](http://www.gama-survey.org/)) survey. 
The N-body simulation was produced by Jonathan Diaz.

The notebooks are descriptive and comprehensive enough to be attempted at your own pace - 
a solution notebook is also provided. The lecture notes explain the intuition behind how 
different machine learning algorithms work.
